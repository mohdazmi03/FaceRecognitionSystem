# Face Recognition System

This project is a **MATLAB-based Face Recognition System** that uses deep learning techniques for real-time face detection and recognition. It allows users to add, remove, retrain, and detect faces while maintaining detailed reports.

## Features
- **Add New Faces**: Capture and store new face data using a webcam.
- **Remove Faces**: Delete specific faces from the dataset.
- **Retrain Model**: Update the face recognition model with new data.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Perform live face recognition using a webcam.
- **Report Generation**: Generate detailed reports on detected faces, including confidence levels and timestamps.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2020b or later.
- A webcam for capturing and detecting faces.
- MATLAB's Deep Learning Toolbox.

## Getting Started

### Installation
