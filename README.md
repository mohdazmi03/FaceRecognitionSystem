# Face Recognition System

This project is a **MATLAB-based Face Recognition System** that uses deep learning techniques for real-time face detection and recognition. It allows users to add, remove, retrain, and detect faces while maintaining detailed reports.

## Features
- **Add New Faces**: Capture and store new face data using a webcam.
- **Remove Faces**: Delete specific faces from the dataset.
- **Retrain Model**: Update the face recognition model with new data.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Perform live face recognition using a webcam.
- **Report Generation**: Generate detailed reports on detected faces, including confidence levels and timestamps.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2020b or later.
- A webcam for capturing and detecting faces.
- MATLAB's 
1. Deep Learning Toolbox
2. Computer Vision Toolbox
3. MATLAB Support Package for USB Webcams
4. Deep Learning Toolbox Model for AlexNet Network
5. Image Processing Toolbox
6. Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
7. MATLAB App Designer (for UI components like uifigure, uibutton, etc.)
